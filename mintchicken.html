    <strong>Description</strong>
    <p>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. 
    Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.
    </p>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>

                In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the 
                flour just to coat, and shake off excess.

                Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken 
                pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover
                and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not 
                over cook the chicken or it will be tough.
