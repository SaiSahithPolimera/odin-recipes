    <strong>Description</strong>
    <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Steps</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.        </li>
    </ol>
